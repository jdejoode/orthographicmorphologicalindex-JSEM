# Contents

This repository contains an index of morphological and orthographic variation at the lexical level in the Hebrew Bible and the larger Dead Sea Scrolls. 

1. Download and unzip [the zip file](https://github.com/jdejoode/orthomorphindex-JSEM/archive/master.zip) or alternatively clone this repository.

1. To navigate the entire index, open Index.html. Depending on your computer, it may take multiple seconds to open this file. 

2. To investigate specific books or scrolls, open the profiles/html folder and choose the relevant book or scroll.

3. The html files use hyperlinks to display the concordances thus creating a simple, but efficient interface that is available offline. The data that is reproduced and enriched only contains the varying items, without any indications of their actual locations in the documents.
